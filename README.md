<h1>VolumeHandGestureControl</h1>
Control your system's volume using your fingertips through computer vision and hand-tracking!


<h2>Overview</h2>
VolumeGestureControl is a Python-based project that leverages computer vision to control the volume of your system by detecting the distance between your thumb and index finger. The closer your fingers are, the lower the volume, and vice versa. 

The project uses the following technologies:
<br>

* MediaPipe: For real-time hand-tracking.
* OpenCV: For video capture and image processing.
* PyCaw: For controlling the system's volume.
<h2>Features</h2>
Real-time Volume Control: Adjust the system's volume by moving your fingertips closer or farther apart.

Hand Tracking: Tracks the hand's movements using MediaPipe's powerful hand-tracking API.

Smooth Volume Adjustment: The volume level changes smoothly based on the distance between fingertips.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
* Python 3.7 or later
* A webcam

<h4>Setup</h4>

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VolumeGestureControl.git
cd VolumeGestureControl

2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3.Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

<h2>Usage</h2>

1.Run the script:
python volume_control.py

2.Control the Volume:

Move your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart to adjust the volume.
The current volume level will be displayed on the screen.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
The webcam captures real-time video feed.
MediaPipe's hand-tracking model detects your hand and identifies the positions of your fingertips.
The distance between the thumb and index finger is calculated.
The distance is mapped to a volume level using the PyCaw library.
The volume is adjusted accordingly.
